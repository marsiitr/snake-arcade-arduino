# Snake Game on Arduino Uno (8x8 LED Matrix)

## üß© Overview  
This project implements the **classic Snake Game** using an **Arduino Uno** and an **8x8 LED Matrix display**.  
The snake moves around the matrix, eats food, and grows in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.  
It‚Äôs a simple yet effective demonstration of real-time logic, LED control, and joystick input on Arduino hardware.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Logic  
- The LED matrix displays the snake and food positions.  
- The joystick controls movement: **Up, Down, Left, Right.**  
- When the snake eats food, its length increases and new food appears randomly.  
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the matrix boundary.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

1. Open `snake.ino` in **Arduino IDE**.  
2. Select **Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Arduino Uno**.  
3. Connect your Arduino via USB.  
4. Upload the sketch to the board.  
5. Play using the joystick once the LED matrix initializes.
