# 🐍 Snake Game on Arduino Uno (8x8 LED Matrix)

> A classic Snake Game implemented on Arduino Uno with an 8x8 LED Matrix and Joystick — demonstrating real-time control, LED animation, and embedded game logic.

---

## 🧭 Introduction  
The **Snake Game on Arduino** is a fun and interactive project that brings a nostalgic game to life using **embedded hardware**.  
It utilizes an **8x8 LED Matrix (MAX7219)** for display and a **joystick module** for directional control.  
Perfect for learning **Arduino programming**, **LED matrix handling**, and **game logic** in real-time systems.

## 🕹️ Game Logic  
- The LED matrix displays the **snake** and **food** positions.  
- The joystick controls movement (**Up**, **Down**, **Left**, **Right**).  
- Eating food increases the snake’s length and places new food randomly.  
- The game ends if the snake **collides with itself** or **the boundary**.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. Open `snake.ino` in **Arduino IDE**.  
2. Select **Tools → Board → Arduino Uno**.  
3. Connect your Arduino via USB.  
4. Upload the sketch to the board.  
5. Once the LED matrix initializes, use the joystick to control your snake!

## 👨‍💻 Developer Instructions  
- The project uses the **LedControl** library to drive the 8x8 LED Matrix.  
- Joystick readings are taken via analog pins **A0** and **A1**, and **digital pin 2** for the switch.  
- Modify variables in the code to change:
  - Snake speed or delay time  
  - Matrix update rate  
  - Game difficulty levels
